# Real-Time Chat App with AI (MERN Stack)

This is a **real-time chat application** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.  
It allows users to securely register/login, create groups, and chat in real time with friends or team members.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Real-time group chat with **MERN stack**
- **AI integration (Google Gemini API)** – interact with AI using `@ai` for instant responses
- AI can **solve coding problems** and **generate MERN stack project structures** (files & folders)
- AI responses appear in a **separate panel** for better usability
- Create **project-based groups** to collaborate with friends (similar to Devin AI)
- Secure user authentication with **JWT**
- Persistent storage of chats, projects, and AI responses
- **Simple and minimal UI** for seamless experience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Register/Login with secure authentication.  
2. Create or join a group/project with friends.  
3. Chat in real time within the group.  
4. Mention **@ai** in chat to interact with AI.  
5. Get AI-generated answers, coding solutions, or project structures in a **separate output panel**.  
6. All data (chats & AI outputs) is saved for future access.  

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Combines **real-time communication** with **AI assistance**  
- Makes project collaboration easier by generating structured development tasks  
- Designed to be simple, clean, and user-friendly
